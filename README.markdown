# appyExpo (the evil hidden brother ...)

This branch is **only** a test, and it's not by any mean a substitute of
the original _AppyExpo_, which is already packaged.

I needed a faily small project for testing some greeeeat tools (bower,
JSHint and the famous vanilla's strict mode).

Also, I had the [sexual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7lxd7RL1To)
need of writing code in separate directories with exotic names.

Build it
```
make build
```
Launch it
```
pyhton2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
See it
```
http://localhost:8000
```
Kill it
```
<ctrl-c>
```
